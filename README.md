## AI-Assisted CT-Based Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection with Explainability and Clinical Reporting

---

## 1. Introduction

**Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)** is a life-threatening neurological condition caused by bleeding within the skull. It is one of the most critical forms of stroke and requires immediate medical attention. Delays in detection and intervention significantly increase the risk of mortality and long-term neurological damage.

**Computed Tomography (CT)** imaging is the primary diagnostic tool used in emergency settings for detecting intracranial hemorrhage due to its speed, availability, and high sensitivity to bleeding. However, accurate interpretation of CT scans requires experienced radiologists and must often be performed under time pressure, especially in emergency departments with high patient volumes.

Artificial intelligence has shown promise in assisting medical image interpretation. However, many AI-based solutions function as **black-box models** and focus solely on prediction accuracy, limiting their trustworthiness and clinical adoption. There is a need for an AI-assisted system that supports early screening while providing transparent and interpretable outputs to aid clinical decision-making.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Intracranial hemorrhage detection from CT brain scans is a critical yet time-sensitive task in emergency medical care. Although CT imaging is effective for identifying hemorrhage, timely and accurate interpretation depends heavily on the availability of skilled radiologists. In high-pressure or resource-constrained environments, delays or misinterpretations can adversely affect patient outcomes.

Existing AI-based approaches for hemorrhage detection often emphasize binary predictions without sufficient explainability or clinical context. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to rely on AI outputs during screening and prioritization.

**The problem addressed in this project** is the absence of an explainable, AI-assisted screening system that can detect intracranial hemorrhage from CT scans while providing interpretable visual evidence and structured clinical explanations to support medical professionals.

> **Note:** The system is intended strictly as a screening and assistive tool, not as a diagnostic replacement for certified medical practitioners.

## 3. Objectives

### Primary Objectives

- To develop an AI-based system capable of detecting intracranial hemorrhage from CT brain images
- To classify CT scans into clearly defined categories: **hemorrhage present** or **absent**
- To assist emergency screening by prioritizing high-risk cases

### Secondary Objectives

- To integrate visual explainability techniques that highlight regions influencing the model's predictions
- To generate structured, human-readable clinical reports summarizing findings
- To evaluate model reliability with emphasis on **false-negative reduction**
- To ensure ethical deployment as a decision-support system rather than a diagnostic authority

---

## 4. Scope of the Project

### Included

---

## 5. Dataset Description

The project utilizes publicly available CT brain imaging datasets from Kaggle, such as:

**Primary datasets:**
- RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Dataset
- CT Brain Hemorrhage Dataset

These datasets contain labeled CT scan images indicating the presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage, with some datasets also providing hemorrhage subtype annotations.

Using public datasets ensures reproducibility, ethical compliance, and feasibility within academic constraints.

---

## 6. Methodology

### 6.1 Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing is essential to improve image quality and model performance:

- Conversion of DICOM images to standardized formats where required
- Image resizing to fixed resolution
- **CT windowing (brain window)** to enhance hemorrhage visibility
- Intensity normalization
- Noise reduction and artifact handling
- Data augmentation to improve generalization and mitigate class imbalance

### 6.2 Model Development

A **convolutional neural network (CNN)** is implemented using transfer learning.

- Pretrained architectures such as **ResNet** or **EfficientNet** are adapted for CT image analysis
- The final classification layer is modified for **binary output**:
  - **Class 0**: No intracranial hemorrhage
  - **Class 1**: Intracranial hemorrhage present
- The model is trained using supervised learning with appropriate loss functions

### 6.3 Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using clinically relevant metrics:

- **Sensitivity (Recall)** – prioritized to reduce missed hemorrhage cases
- Specificity
- Precision
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

> **Note:** Accuracy alone is not treated as a sufficient indicator of clinical usefulness.

---

## 7. Explainability Module

To ensure transparency and trustworthiness:

- **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)** will be applied
- Heatmaps are generated to visualize regions contributing to predictions
- Highlighted areas are analyzed in relation to known hemorrhage patterns in CT images

This module allows clinicians to visually verify AI decisions rather than relying solely on binary outputs.

### 7.1 Explainability Quality Assurance

To ensure the reliability of explainability outputs:

- **Sanity checks** will be implemented (e.g., occlusion/perturbation tests) to verify Grad-CAM is not highlighting irrelevant borders, text markers, or artifacts
- Failure cases where heatmaps are misleading will be documented
- For a sample of True Positives, False Negatives, and False Positives, Grad-CAM overlays will include brief qualitative notes comparing:
  - What the model highlights
  - What a clinician would expect to see
- This ensures visual evidence aligns with clinical reasoning

---

## 8. Confidence-Aware Screening

Instead of a simple binary output, the system incorporates prediction confidence:

- **High-confidence hemorrhage detection** → urgent attention
- **Low-confidence predictions** → manual review recommendation

This approach reflects real-world screening workflows and reduces over-reliance on automated decisions.

### 8.1 Confidence Calibration

To ensure clinicians can trust the confidence scores:

- **Calibration techniques** will be applied (e.g., temperature scaling or isotonic regression)
- Both **raw probability** and **calibrated confidence** will be reported
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE) will be evaluated
- Three confidence bands will be defined:
  - **High confidence**: urgent attention required
  - **Medium confidence**: standard review
  - **Low confidence**: manual review recommended
- Error rates will be analyzed across each confidence band to support triage decisions

---

## 9. Clinical Report Generation

A structured report generation module converts model outputs into human-readable explanations. Each report includes:

- Screening outcome summary
- Prediction confidence
- Visual explainability reference
- Clinical interpretation phrased as decision support

The report avoids diagnostic claims and emphasizes assistive screening.

### 9.1 Report Schema and Specifications

To prevent diagnostic claims and ensure consistency:

- A **fixed schema** will be defined with specific fields and allowed phrases
- Reports will be locked down with rules to ensure they never make diagnostic claims
- Each report field will have:
  - **Screening outcome**: "Hemorrhage detected" or "No hemorrhage detected" (not "diagnosed")
  - **Confidence level**: Numeric probability + calibrated confidence band
  - **Visual evidence**: Reference to Grad-CAM heatmap image
  - **Recommended action**: "Urgent radiologist review recommended" or "Standard review workflow"
  - **System disclaimer**: Clear statement that this is a screening tool, not a diagnostic device
- Standardized phrasing ensures clinical safety and legal compliance

### Clinical Risk Evaluation Protocol

To address these risks systematically:

- **Target operating points** will be defined (e.g., "maximize sensitivity subject to acceptable specificity")
- **False negative analysis**: Pre-commit to reviewing all false negative cases with detailed inspection:
  - Inspect FN scans with Grad-CAM overlays
  - Document typical failure patterns (e.g., small bleeds, beam-hardening artifacts, post-operative changes)
  - Use findings to refine preprocessing or model architecture
- Each component of the system architecture will be evaluated using the framework:
  - **Inputs** → **Outputs** → **Metrics** → **Failure Modes** → **Mitigations**
- This structured approach ensures risks are systematically addressed before deployment

Mitigation strategies will be implemented during development and documented in evaluation.

## 18. Conclusion

This project aims to develop an AI-assisted screening system for intracranial hemorrhage detection that prioritizes **clinical utility**, **explainability**, and **ethical deployment**. By combining deep learning with transparency mechanisms, confidence calibration, and structured reporting, the system is designed to support—not replace—clinical decision-making.

The systematic approach to risk evaluation, comprehensive ablation studies, and focus on false negative reduction ensure that the system addresses real clinical needs while acknowledging its limitations as a screening tool.

Through this project, we demonstrate that responsible AI in healthcare requires not just prediction accuracy, but also interpretability, calibration, careful validation, and explicit acknowledgment of system boundaries.
